Chef Stock is a chef-centric WebUI that allows for visualizing chef server data. It was originally created at the ChefConf 2013 Hackathon on 4/27/2013 as a AWS Console replacement for managing non-EC2 nodes

To get started you must have a chef workstation setup on your machine. If knife works, just do  the below commands, and you're good to go!

* git clone git@github.com:systemizer/chef_stock.git
* cd chef_stock
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* python manage.py runserver
